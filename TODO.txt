- press and hold Z to bring up menu
	- create build bar object
		- build bar is a fixed rect
		- buttons can be generated (and have to be available as objects). Make a function that takes in build_bar and table of sprites:
			- using build bar x0, y0
			- using sprite's width
			- using gap between buttons
			- in the end we want
			buttons = {
				{
					x0 = 1,
					y0 = 1,
					x1 = 1, -- given x0, use sprite width to work this out
					y1 = 1,
					col = 1,
					inner_button = {
						x0 = 1,
						y0 = 1,
						x1 = 1, -- given x0, use sprite width to work this out
						y1 = 1,
						col = 1,
					},
					icon = {
						x0 = 1,
						y0 = 1,
						sprite = 1
					}
				}, ..and so on for rest of buttons
			}



MVP
- build road (press X)
- build house (press X)
- delete road/house (press X) (maybe becomes a red cursor?)
- query road/house/grass (press X) (maybe becomes a blue cursor?)
- sound effects
- animations/visual effects
- intro: text. You are glorious leader. Build a village with at least 50 people
- win screen
cursor, advanced:
- get a pixel in top right, and move it with arrows
- print coordinates of corners of cursor; when cursor moves, corners move
- create a function that takes in cursor and pixel - move the pixel along border:
	- starts in top left
	- moves to the left by one pixel every frame 
		- ie its y value is always same as top left
		- when it hits top right, it's x value is always same as top-right
		- and so on...
- create sn L-shaped line of an array of pixel coordinates
	- for each pixel in L-shape, run it through the above function

Nice-to-haves:
- birds flying above
- leaves or butterflies floating across
- build menu slowly moves up on hold Z
- move build_bar buttons in middle instead of justified to the left. This will give room at edges of bar to pixel-art it into a board 

DONE:
cursor:
- basic bordered movement
